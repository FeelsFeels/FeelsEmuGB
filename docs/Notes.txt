==============================
====== Design Decisions ======
==============================
My emulator is built with the goal of helping myself (and others!) better understand the Game Boy.
I want lots of debug info. I want the ability to inspect the values. I want the user to KNOW what is happening under the hood.
I want to implement the scrolling visualizer just like the Ultimate Game Boy Talk displayed.
I want a sound visualizer as well.


Components:
Game Boy
CPU
Bus/MMU
PPU
Cartridge


====================
====== NOTES =======
====================
On the memory map:
The GB has a 16-bit address space, 0x0000 - 0xFFFF

0000	3FFF	16 KiB: Cartridge. Fixed Bank
4000	7FFF	16 KiB: Cartridge. Switchable ROM Bank. We access "extra memory" in the cartridge (Pokémon red is 512KB!) in this address range via the Memory Bank Controller (MBC).
8000	9FFF	 8 KiB: Video RAM. Tile Data, Tile Maps. Important for the PPU.
A000	BFFF	 8 KiB: External RAM. This lives on the cartridge. I think this is where the save files can live.
C000	DFFF	 8 KiB: Work RAM.
E000	FDFF this section is broken. It's a mirror of C000-DDFF. Just don't use this, or redirect to the work RAM.
FE00	FE9F	     : Object Attribute Memory (OAM). Holds up to 40 sprites.
FEA0	FEFF	Not Usable
FF00	FF7F	     : I/O Registers
FF80	FFFE	     : High RAM (HRAM). 127 bytes of RAM that can be accessed faster (similar to CPU cache)
FFFF	FFFF	Interrupt Enable register (IE)

On "Registers":
The CPU has registers, but the docs also mention the cartridge having registers.
The registers of the cartridge are better thought of as control switches than the standard definition of registers on the CPU.

On CPU Registers:
7 General 8-bit registers: A B C D E H L
Some registers can be combined to make 16 bit registers: AF, BC, DE, HL
A refers to Hi bits of AF. F is the flags register.
A register is special. It is the accumulator. The only register that can be used for certain load instructions.
HL register is usually the only register that can be used for addresses when accessing memory.

Two more registers, SP & PC, for stack and program pointer.



On the Boot ROM:
Exists in 0000-00FF. Recall that the entry point of the cartridge is 0100-0103.
This small program, the boot ROM, is burned inside the CPU, and is mapped over (overlapped) the cartridge ROM on startup.
This means that the boot ROM supercedes the cartridge code inside 0000-00FF until it finishes.
After finishing, the boot ROM hands off control to the cartridge at 0x0100.
