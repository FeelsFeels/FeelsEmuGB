====================
====== NOTES =======
====================
On the memory map:
The GB has a 16-bit address space, 0x0000 - 0xFFFF

0000	3FFF	16 KiB: Cartridge. Fixed Bank
4000	7FFF	16 KiB: Cartridge. Switchable ROM Bank. We access "extra memory" in the cartridge (Pokémon red is 512KB!) in this address range via the Memory Bank Controller (MBC).
8000	9FFF	 8 KiB: Video RAM. Tile Data, Tile Maps. Important for the PPU.
A000	BFFF	 8 KiB: External RAM. This lives on the cartridge. I think this is where the save files can live.
C000	DFFF	 8 KiB: Work RAM.
E000	FDFF this section is broken. It's a mirror of C000-DDFF. Just don't use this, or redirect to the work RAM.
FE00	FE9F	     : Object Attribute Memory (OAM). Holds up to 40 sprites.
FEA0	FEFF	Not Usable
FF00	FF7F	     : I/O Registers
FF80	FFFE	     : High RAM (HRAM). 127 bytes of RAM that can be accessed faster (similar to CPU cache)
FFFF	FFFF	Interrupt Enable register (IE)
